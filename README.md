I have just completed a Jianken JGL-80 2.2KW ATC upgrade with dockable dust boot. I used this and other websites to give me a great base to start with. One of the issues was the information was fragmented or contained small errors in code. I want to give back to the community by making my entire package available for those that want to embark on a similar adventure. The Mach3 files may have a .pp file extension but are actually Cyprus Basic not pascal. The contents of the .pp files are posted in to the appropriate button in Mach3 if required.

This includes:
1. M6 tool change macro;
2. Tool Offset macro (to automatically update tool table);
3. ATC tool 0 (set zero height with tool);
4. Screen set with new ATC page and modified page one so there is no need to go to ATC page for setting up and running programs; 
5. Spread sheet with pin out. (Uses Mach3 with Smooth stepper, C10 board and 2 BOBs);
6. STL files for removable dust boot with 80mm dia router ;
7. Arduino Uno code (for monitoring Router temp /pressure and signal state of clamps). 
8. Mach 3 Brains 
9. Some video/photos of installation/system; and
10. Vectric post processor to handle ATC air seal.
