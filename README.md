I have just completed a Jianken JGL-80 2.2KW ATC upgrade with dockable dust boot. I used this and other websites to give me a great base to start with. One of the issues was the information was fragmented or contained small errors in code. I want to give back to the community by making my entire package available for those that want to embark on a similar adventure. The Mach3 files may have a .pp file extension but are actually Cyprus Basic not pascal. The contents of the .pp files are pasted in to the appropriate button in Mach3 if required.

This includes:
1. M6 tool change macro;
2. Tool Offset macro (to automatically update tool table);
3. ATC tool 0 (set zero height with tool);
4. Screen set with new ATC page and modified page one; 
5. Spread sheet with pin out (Smooth stepper, C10 board and 2 BOBs);
6. STL files and freecad file for removable dust boot;
7. Arduino code (for monitoring Router temp and signal state of clamps). Parts list for Arduino;
8. Some video/photos of installation/system; and
9. Vectric post processor.

Use at own risk
